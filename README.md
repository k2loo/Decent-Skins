## How to use
1. Make a backup copy of any plugin folders you will be updating.

2. Download the zip file from the downloads folder here and unzip it.
    -  Close VCV Rack if it's running.

3. Copy/paste the Decent Skins svg files where the current files for panel backgrounds are, within in the `res` folder for each brand's plugin folder. The new files should have the same names and locations as the originals, replacing them.
    - Find it by opening VCV Rack and right clicking on a module > info > open plugin folder, [like this.](/.github/plugin-folder-location.png) Once found, close VCV Rack and paste the files.

4. Open VCV Rack and enjoy.

## FAQ

*Why are the screws in my modules still light?*

A: That's baked into the plugin code for many modules, the files provided here are only background images.

*Q: How do I revert to the default skins?*

A: There are two methods.

1. You could replace the Decent Skins svg files with the originals, also available in this repo.
2. You could unsubscribe from your modules for a moment and then resubscribe to them.

In any case, closing the VCV Rack app and reopening it will cause it to read the plugin folders and notice any changes.

Disclaimer: If a module gets updated by it's maker, you may have to replace the default background files with Decent Skins files again.
